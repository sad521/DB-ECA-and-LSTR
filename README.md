# DB-ECA-and-LSTR
DB-EAC and LSTR: DBnet based seal text detection and Lightweight Seal Text Recognition<br/>
# Introduction
This project mainly serves the detection and recognition of seals. DB-ECA can detect the position of seals and LSTR is used to recognize the text of seals.<br/>
The code relies on the Paddle platform for implementation, and detailed deployment scenarios can be viewed atï¼šhttps://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR<br/>
The fastest way to start is to replace our file based on PaddleOCR and run it<br/>
